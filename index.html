						<h2>About Me</h2>
						
						<p>
							I was born in Nashville, Tennessee, but spent the vast majority of my life growing up in Mandeville, Louisiana.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Growing up, I always enjoyed learning about the world around me - a trait I've carried with me into adulthood.
							As an active member of the Boy Scouts of America from the age of 10 until I left for college at 18, I had the
							opportunity to go on some great adventures. Some of them took me down the waterways the French fur traders traveled 
							200 years ago in Minnesota. Others sent me over 12,000 ft high on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldy_Mountain_(Colfax_County,_New_Mexico)" target="_blank">Mount Baldy</a> 
							(an altitude this Louisianan  was not accustomed to). Through all of these outings, I didn't just learn new things, 
							I got to experience them. Because of this, I find I prefer hands-on, personal experience to textbook knowledge.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Right before my senior year of high school, I was introduced to HTML and CSS, the backbone languages to the world wide web
							and websites as we know them today. Enthralled, I began learning more and more about web development. After starting to
							learn JavaScript, I became interested in the idea of making apps for the Android platform. I immediately began learning Java
							and experimenting with different types of code, which is when I got the idea to pursue Computer Science as a major in college.
							The rest is history.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							With a passion for both experiencing what the world has to offer and computer science, I hope to make a difference
							in the world using the skills and knowledge I have gained from my experiences. I am eager to see what the next chapters in my
							life hold and hope to live them fully.

								In pursuing a concentration in cyber security for computer science, I have been made aware of what cyber security is
								and what efforts I can make in my own applications (both on and off the web) to prevent hackers from gaining access
								to resources they shouldn't. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								The highlight of my education in cyber security would be taking CSC 442, Introduction
								to Cyber Security during Spring quarter of 2014. At the end of the quarter, we held a competition called <a href="http://coes.latech.edu/cyber-engineering/cyberstorm/" target="_blank">Cyber Storm</a>, 
								where the class was divided into four teams (each named after a house from Hogwarts, the wizarding school from Harry Potter). 
							</p>	
							<p>
								At the end of the quarter, the four teams competed in solving challenges and attempting to compromise systems set up 
								by the administrators and each other. I learned a great deal about web and wireless security during the competition.
								After eight grueling hours, our team managed to win. Go Team Hufflepuff!

								Another area of computer science I have developed at Louisiana Tech is database design and management. Through taking the
								course CSC 499 (Database Management Systems), I first learned the basics of MySQL: select, update, delete, and insert.
								By the end of the course, we had learned about more sophisticated queries using joins and unions. I along with two 
								classmates designed and built a database and simple web applicaton to display demographic information pertaining to each
								of the 50 states and their respective counties. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Recently, my knowledge of databases has been greatly enhanced through
								a research opportunity at Louisiana Tech. While working for the university, I have been exposed to Microsoft SQL Server 
								and T-SQL. Additionally, my knowledge and skills with SQL have become much more advanced.

							<h1>The Quad Tree</h1>
		                    <hr>
		                    <p>I implemented this data structure winter quarter of my freshman year in an effort to render sprites to a mobile device screen as efficiently as possible (after all, more efficiency = more FPS). While I never got around to making the
		                        game in Android I wanted to use this with, I still have this to be proud of.</p>
		                    <p>The quad tree is a data structure that is very similar to the binary tree. It is made up of nodes, which have children and parents. However, each node in a quad tree has four children instead of two like a binary tree. The quad tree
		                        is commonly used to divide 2 dimension euclidean space. The root of the tree represents the entire space. Each child represent one fourth of its parent, dividing the parent across the middle both vertically and horizontally.
		                        This process continues with the children until a minimum size is reached. The quad tree proves its effectiveness in one particular area of game design: collision detection. Every sprite (or image) in a game that interacts with
		                        others sprites must be surrounded by a rectangle called a bounding box. This bounding box is checked each cycle with the other sprites bounding boxes to see if there are any overlaps a.k.a collisions. This can become very time
		                        consuming very quickly as the number of sprites increase. Since each sprite would have to check all other sprites, this procedure yields a worst case complexity of O( n * [n-1]) or O( n<sup>2</sup> ).</p>
		                    <p>The quad tree solves this problem by dividing up the coordinate space and assigning each sprite a parent node. The parent node is the smallest node in the tree that can fully contain the sprite's bounding box inside it. Sprites then
		                        only need to check for collisions with sprites with the same parent and sprites whose parents are the parent or ancestor of their parent node. In typical scenarios, where sprites are spread rather evenly across the map, this drastically
		                        reduces the number of collision checks made each cycle.</p>

		                    </div>
		                    <hr>
		                    <p>In the example shown in the photo, there are 2,000 sprites being rendered and moved across the screen. Rather than each sprite checking the other 1,999, they each check only those in their parent and its ancestors. Sprites that are
		                        not colliding are drawn black. The others are drawn in different colors at random. The nodes themselves are highlighted if they are not empty as blue boxes. In this particular case, the simulation could run at roughly 17 - 22 ms
		                        per cycle (~60 FPS), whereas the brute force technique could barely achieve 200 - 300 ms per cycle (under 5 FPS).</p>

							<h1>Steganography</h1>
		                    <hr>
		                    <p>Steganography is a process of embedding information (like a message) in a communication medium such that only people looking for the hidden information would be able to find it.</p>
		                    <p>It differs from encryption in that encryption is easily noticeable (you can very easily tell when a file has been encrypted due to the scrambled contents of the file), but it is next to impossible to decipher without the encryption key. Conversely, the goal of steganography is not to make the information indecipherable, but unnoticeable. For this reason, digital steganography is typically done on images, where changing the red, green, or blue values by only a slight amount would produce a nearly identical image to the human eye, but would contain binary information that could be extracted by the intended recipient.</p>
		                    <hr>
		                    <div class="row text-center" style="padding: 12px;">

		                    <hr>
		                    <p>This program works by changing the least significant bit of all available color channels (RGB or ARGB) in a BMP or PNG image to encode a text message within the image. The user can enter an optional key for further security. The message can only be recovered using the extractor in the program and the right key. The image above has some steganographic text embedded in it. Try downloading the image, the software, and run it with the highly secure key 'password'.</p>
		                    <p>To learn more about steganography, check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank">Wikipedia Page</a> on it.</p>

								So my family and I are heading to the beach for vacation this summer. Like always when going to the beach, my dad and I plan on doing a lot of
								kite flying. In the past, we attempted to bring a small video camera up with a kite and get some photos of the beach. As you can see from the photo 
								we had mild success with that project. The video camera was cheap and we had no way of knowing what it was actually filming at any time. In
								fact, a majority of the footage we got was garbage, all we could do was extract individual frames from the video clips to get some neat still photos.
								This time, we want to take it a step further and see if we can improve the project.

						<div class="col-md-7">

								The first step for this was planning. We knew we needed to be able to send information from the kite back down to the ground in order to stream photos, but
								we also wanted to have the option to pan or tilt the camera on the kite from the ground. We also knew we wanted to get the kite much higher (over 500ft) than last
								time. My dad took charge of purchasing and constructing the kite and harness for the camera, my job was implementing the hardware and software for the project
								to run. I settled on using Raspberry Pis, due to their cost, computing power, and huge amount of available libraries and support. One Raspberry Pi wasn't going
								to be enough, though. We needed one on the ground as a base station to communicate with the kite. We decided one using the XBee wireless modules for wireless
								communication between the two Pis. The XBee modules are based on the ZigBee protocol, a wireless network stack that allows for point-to-point and mesh wireless
								communication between microcontrollers. We settled on the XBee Pro 900, because it runs on the 900 MHz band instead of the crowded 2.4 GHz band. These wireless
								modules have a theoretical range of 1 mile (1500m) and can transmit about 250 Kbps, perfect for sending low resolution photos from the kite down to the base station.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another aspect to consider was what to do with the data once it got to the base station. I decided the simplest solution was to create a wireless access point using the Pi.
								Basically, the base station Raspberry Pi would behave like a wireless router and create a network for other devices to connect to. Once connected to the Wi-Fi network, any
								device could view the photos downloaded from the kite using the base station pi. Commands could also be sent up to the kite to pan or tilt the camera using a web-interface
								hosted by the base station.
